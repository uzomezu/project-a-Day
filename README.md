"# project-a-Day" 


This is post one in my development challenge to hopefully develop a PWA(Progressive Web App) in 60 days using my JS technology and some cool libraries I want to learn.

Rules : 
1. Technologies I can use:
a. HTML
b. Bootstrap
c. JavaScript(EcmaScript 6 notation)
d. Node.js
e. Vue.js
f. THREE.js

2. Point System 
- (bronze) = 1 point(s) HTML,CSS
- (silver) =  2.5 points JS ; 5 points THREE
- (gold)  = 5 points Vue ; 7.5 points Node
